var PI = 3.14;
PI = 42; // stop me from doing this!

Here's how you stop it:
const PI = 3.14;
PI = 42; // this is impossible now

Quiz:
Var is scoped to the function while let is scopped to a block. 
Var is also hoisted and can be referred to in an earlier line in the code, earlier than where the initialization of the variable happened.
Let is not hoisted.
Var can be reassigned and redeclared while let can only be reassigned.

Var is scoped to the function while const is scoped to a block.
Var is hoisted and can be referred to in a line that is earlier in code that the point of that variable's initialization.
Const is not hoisted.
Const cannot be redeclared or reassigned while var can be redeclared and reassigned.

Let and const are both block scoped.
Let can be reassigned but not redeclared
Const cannot be reassigned or redeclared.

Hoisting happens with var when all the var variables initializations happen at the beginning of the scope. 
Hoisting does not happen with let or const.
